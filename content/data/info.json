I know it is very barebones right now, but we'll get there.  </p><p>I am supposedly a CS engineer-in-training by trade, but what excites me is often not the same thing as what I like. And I feel the very act of writing a blog is what will make me figure my life out right now. Cheers, and welcome to the journey.</p>",
