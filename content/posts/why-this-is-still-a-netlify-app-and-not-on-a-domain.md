title: Why this is still a Netlify App and not on a domain
author: Dhruv Nagpal

I've been working to set this website up for some time now (read, 10 minutes a night). Now that I finally know what CMS I want to use, if I want a proper self-hosted blog or just Medium, and whether I want to really blog or not, I get held up by the most fundamental thing.

I cannot register my domain at a reasonable cost.

And it sucks.

When the powers-that-be decided to connect a bunch of computers and connect the internet, what they didn't expect was that it would have so much Reddit. What they also didn't expect was a complete breakdown of their elaborate scheme of TLDs into everyone and everything being a .com address. And thus, when I should in theory be well-served by just a something like dhruvnagpal.me, or dhruvnagpal.name, or (considering that this is at the moment just a blog), dhruvnagpal.blog, I wanted the big fish. I wanted dhruvnagpal.com.

And just as well, some random idiot on the internet decided to take that domain before me. To do what, you ask?![](/content/images/dhruvnagpal-com-landing-page.png)

"Ah well, this might be a random error, let me see if I can buy it from the owner," I said to myself. How expensive could it be?

Yeah, no thanks. GoDaddy is asking me for this much money just for the opportunity to _ask_ the owner of another site _if_ I can buy it from them. I'll have to pay more money to both GoDaddy and the owner if I do end up getting the website. It would be more prudent to wait till
